        <h2> ABOUT </h2>
        <div>
            <p>My name is Sara Cearc. I have always been interested in coding and web development. When I was a little girl I would watch my father work on his computers. This was back in the 90's so i'm talking overly big monitor, huge tower, the works. That is what I grew up on, and when whenever there was a new computer coming out I wanted it. I orignially went to college for interior design, but as I was taking my courses I realised what I wanted to do most was work with computers, and the coding aspect surrounding them.</p>
            <p>I started dabbling in coding on my own, and soon realised there was way more out there to learn. I went to college for computer science for one semester, but soon realised this was going to take all my time, and money. I started looking for other options to learn to code. I tried different apps for coding basics, which they did teach me the basic components of laying out a webpage. Then one day I sawan add for Lambda. The main title was pay NOTHING up front, that right there caught my attention.</p>
            <p>Could I really learn everything I needed to know about coding to get a well paying job in just 9 months, and not have to pay anything upfront? I was skeptical at first, but by looking more into Lambda I realised  it was the real deal, and I had to give it a try. So here I am, on my journey to my new career as a Full stack web developer, and I couldn't be happier! Is it hard? Yes, but is it worth it? 100%! This journey is going to be long, and rough, but I know with detication and drive I will make it to my dream job!</p>
