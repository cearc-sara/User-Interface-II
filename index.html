        <p>I have always been interested in computers ever since I was a little girl. When I was in highschool I had a friend who taught me the basics for coding. From then on I was hooked, and wanted to learn more about coding. I dabled in html on my own for awhile, and finally realised I needed to get into a program that would help me further my career in pregramming. That's when I joined Lambda. Coding has always been a passion of mine, and now I am excited to be able to graduate this program, and get a job in the field I have always loved!</p>
